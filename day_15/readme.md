# Day 15: Review and Testing 🕵️‍♀️🧪

**Tasks:**

1. 🕵️‍♂️ Conduct a thorough review of your system:
   - Look at each component (Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, AWS EC2 instances) and ensure that they're configured correctly and working as expected.
   - Check the logs for any errors or warnings that might need to be addressed.

2. 🧪 Test your data pipeline:
   - Send data through your pipeline and verify that it's correctly ingested by Kafka, processed by Spark, and stored in HDFS.
   - Ensure that the processed data is in the expected format and contains the right information.

3. 🎯 Test your machine learning model:
   - Use new data to test your model and ensure that it's making accurate predictions.
   - Evaluate the model's performance metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) and ensure they meet your requirements.

4. 🚨 Test your monitoring and alerting:
   - Verify that your system metrics (like CPU usage, memory usage, etc.) are being correctly monitored.
   - Trigger some test alerts to verify that the alerting mechanism works as expected.

5. 📝 Document your work:
   - Write a report detailing your setup, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them. 
   - Include details about your data pipeline, machine learning model, monitoring setup, etc.
   - This will be useful for future reference and for demonstrating your work to others.

**Study:**

📚 Here's what you should focus on learning today:

- System testing methodologies:
  - Understand how to test each component of your system and the system as a whole.

- Troubleshooting:
  - Learn techniques for debugging issues in distributed systems.

- Technical writing:
  - Learn how to write clear and concise technical documentation.
