# Day 12-13: Monitoring and Logging 🔍📝

**Tasks:**

1. 📝 Implement logging:
   - Add logging statements to your Kafka, Spark, and Hadoop applications. 
   - These statements can record important events, errors, and other useful information. 
   - Logs can be incredibly helpful for understanding what your applications are doing and debugging issues.

2. 👀 Set up monitoring:
   - Use a tool like AWS CloudWatch or Grafana to monitor your system. 
   - These tools can track and visualize various metrics like CPU and memory usage, network traffic, disk I/O, etc.
   - Monitoring these metrics can help you ensure your system is performing optimally and catch issues before they become major problems.

3. 🚨 Create alerts:
   - Based on the metrics you're monitoring, set up alerts to notify you of potential issues. 
   - For example, you could create an alert that sends you an email if CPU usage goes above 80% or if disk space is running low.

**Study:**

📚 Here's what you should focus on learning today:

- Logging in your chosen programming language:
  - Learn how to add logging statements to your code. 
  - Understand different logging levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) and when to use each.

- AWS CloudWatch or Grafana documentation:
  - Learn how to set up monitoring for your AWS EC2 instances and how to create alerts based on certain thresholds.

- System monitoring basics:
  - Understand what metrics are important to monitor in a data processing system and why.
