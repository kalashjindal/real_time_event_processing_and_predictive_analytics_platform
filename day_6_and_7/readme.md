# Day 6-7: Data Processing and Storage 🔄💾

**Tasks:**

1. 👀 Understand the data:
   - Take a close look at the data you're consuming from Kafka. 
   - What is its structure? What kind of information does it hold? 
   - Understanding your data is critical for knowing how to process and use it effectively.

2. 📝 Write a Spark job to consume data from Kafka:
   - This job will read data from the Kafka topic. 
   - If your data is streaming in real time, you can use Spark Streaming. 
   - For batch data (data collected over periods of time and processed all at once), you can use standard Spark APIs.

3. 🔄 Transform the data:
   - Based on your understanding of the data, perform the necessary transformations. 
   - You might need to filter out irrelevant data, clean up messy or inconsistent data, or aggregate data for easier analysis. 
   - You can use Spark's transformation functions to perform these tasks.

4. 💾 Store the transformed data:
   - Write the transformed data into Hadoop's HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). 
   - This is a distributed file system designed to hold large amounts of data. 
   - You can write data to HDFS using Spark's write APIs.

5. ✅ Validate the results:
   - Once you've written data into HDFS, take a look at it. 
   - Is it correctly transformed? Does it match your expectations? 
   - Verifying your results ensures that your data processing and storage steps are working correctly.

**Study:**

📚 Here's what you should focus on learning today:

- Spark Streaming documentation:
  - Learn how to consume data from Kafka in real time using Spark Streaming.

- Spark's transformation functions:
  - Understand how to use functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc. to transform your data.

- Spark's HDFS integration:
  - Learn how to write data into HDFS using Spark. This will be critical for storing your processed data.

- Hadoop's HDFS:
  - Understand the basics of HDFS, including how data is stored and how to read data from it.
