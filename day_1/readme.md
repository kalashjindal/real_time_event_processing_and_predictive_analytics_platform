# Day 1: Project Planning 📝

**Tasks:**

1. 🎯 Define the project's primary objective: 
   - Understand the key aim of your project. What are you looking to achieve with it? 
   - Are you looking to process data in real time, or are you focusing on predictive analytics? 
   - Clearly defining the objective will help you scope your project and identify the necessary tools and resources.

2. 📊 Identify the data:
   - What kind of data will you be working with? 
   - Is it streaming data (data that's continuously generated in real time), batch data (data that's collected over periods of time and processed all at once), or a mixture of both? 
   - Understand the volume (how much data) and velocity (how fast the data is generated and processed) of your data. This will help you design your data pipeline and choose the right tools.

3. 🏗 Define your high-level system architecture:
   - Identify the components of your system. 
   - You might use Apache Kafka for data ingestion (bringing data into the system), Apache Spark for data processing and machine learning (transforming and analyzing the data), and Apache Hadoop for data storage (storing the data for future use).
   - Defining the architecture will give you a roadmap for setting up and connecting your system components.

4. 💻 Identify the hardware and software requirements for your project:
   - Based on the volume and velocity of your data and the requirements of your chosen tools (Kafka, Spark, and Hadoop), identify the hardware you'll need (like servers and network infrastructure) and the software you'll use (like operating systems and software libraries).

**Study:**

📚 Here's what you should focus on learning today:

- Data Engineering Basics: 
  - Understand the fundamental concepts of data engineering, including the roles of data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis in a data pipeline.

- Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop:
  - Learn about these tools and their roles in a data pipeline. 
  - Kafka is often used for data ingestion, Spark for data processing and machine learning, and Hadoop for data storage.

- Project Management Basics:
  - Learn the basics of project management, like how to define your project's scope (what it will and won't do), how to set objectives (what you want to achieve), and how to estimate timelines (how long each part of the project should take).
