# Day 4-5: Data Ingestion with Apache Kafka 📊🔄

**Tasks:**

1. 🔍 Identify your data sources: 
   - Where is your data coming from? 
   - It could be a public API, a database, a file, or even real-time data from a device sensor. 
   - Understanding your data source is important for planning how to ingest it into your system.

2. 📝 Write a Kafka producer script:
   - Choose a programming language you're comfortable with - it could be Python, Java, or another language. 
   - Your script will act as a producer, which reads data from the data source and sends it into a Kafka topic. 
   - Kafka topics are like channels where producers send data and from which consumers read data.

3. 📖 Write a Kafka consumer script:
   - This script will act as a consumer, which reads data from a Kafka topic. 
   - This helps you verify that data ingestion is working correctly – the consumer should be able to read all data sent by the producer.

4. 🧪 Test your setup with sample data:
   - To ensure everything is working correctly, send some sample data through your system. 
   - This means having your producer script read the sample data from your data source and send it to a Kafka topic, then having your consumer script read the data from the topic.

**Study:**

📚 Here's what you should focus on learning today:

- Apache Kafka documentation:
  - Understand how Kafka topics work and how to write Kafka producers and consumers. 

- Kafka library for your chosen programming language:
  - Each language has its own way of interacting with Kafka. 
  - Libraries like Confluent's Kafka Python or Apache Kafka's Java client can help you write your producer and consumer scripts.

- Your data source:
  - Learn about your specific data source and how to connect to it and read data from it. 
  - The methods will differ depending on whether it's an API, a database, a file, etc.
