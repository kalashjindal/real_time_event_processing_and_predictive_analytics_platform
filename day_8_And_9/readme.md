# Day 8-9: Machine Learning with Spark MLlib ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

**Tasks:**

1. ðŸŽ¯ Understand the problem:
   - Define the problem you want to solve with machine learning. 
   - This could be predicting future sales based on past data, classifying emails as spam or not spam, etc. 
   - Understanding the problem well will guide your choice of data, features, and machine learning algorithm.

2. ðŸ“Š Prepare your data:
   - Once you've defined your problem, choose the relevant features from your data. Features are the variables that your machine learning model will use to make predictions.
   - Clean your data and handle any missing or inconsistent values. This is crucial for building a model that performs well.
   - Transform your data into a format suitable for machine learning, typically a numerical format. 

3. ðŸš€ Train your model:
   - Use Spark's MLlib library to train a machine learning model. 
   - Start with a simple model like linear regression. You can move to more complex models as you get more comfortable.

4. âœ… Validate your model:
   - To ensure your model is working well, split your data into a training set and a test set. 
   - Train your model on the training set, then test it on the test set. This will give you an idea of how your model performs on unseen data.

**Study:**

ðŸ“š Here's what you should focus on learning today:

- Spark MLlib documentation:
  - Understand how to prepare data for machine learning, and how to train a model using MLlib. 

- Machine learning basics:
  - Learn about key concepts like features, labels, training sets, test sets, and model validation.

- Your chosen algorithm:
  - Understand how the algorithm you chose (like linear regression) works. 
  - Learn how to use it in Spark MLlib, including any necessary data preparation and model training steps.
