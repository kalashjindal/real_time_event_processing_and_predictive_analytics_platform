# Day 10-11: Data Analysis and Visualization 📊🎨

**Tasks:**

1. 🎯 Define your analysis goals:
   - What are the key questions you want your data to answer? 
   - What insights are you hoping to extract? 
   - Defining clear analysis goals will guide your subsequent steps.

2. 📝 Write Spark SQL queries to analyze your data:
   - Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. 
   - You can use it to interact with your data in HDFS and write SQL queries to perform the analysis you defined in the previous step.

3. 🖼️ Visualize your analysis:
   - Visualizations can make your analysis results easier to understand and communicate. 
   - Use Python libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to create visualizations of your analysis results. 
   - Depending on your data, these could be simple bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, or more complex visualizations like heat maps.

**Study:**

📚 Here's what you should focus on learning today:

- Spark SQL documentation:
  - Understand how to write SQL queries in Spark and how to interact with your data in HDFS using Spark SQL.

- Data analysis basics:
  - Learn how to define clear analysis goals and how to translate those goals into SQL queries.

- Matplotlib or Plotly documentation:
  - Learn how to create different types of visualizations. 
  - Each type of visualization can highlight different aspects of your data, so it's useful to know how to create a variety of them.
